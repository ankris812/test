# Gibbon CMS
A serverless CMS that runs on Github Pages

## Features
- Blog Hosting
- Easy to edit pages
- Free Hosting on Github Pages
- Completely free and Open Source

## Motivation
Github Pages offers free static site hosting and even allows domain mapping, so it is an ideal candidate to base a free static CMS on. Many people don't need server-side code for their sites, and could greatly reduce server costs, especially for open source projects.

Another strong motivator was to create a very bare-bones CMS that has themes that are very similar to native HTML/CSS.
